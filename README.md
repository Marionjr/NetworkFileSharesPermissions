<h1>Network File Sharing and Permissions </h1>
In this tutorial, we will share out resources on the network, give permissions and deny access to individual domain users and groups. <br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: Azure Virtual Machines, Wireshark, and Network Security Groups](https://www.youtube.com)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Server Manager
- Active Directory
  

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Windows Server 2019

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Using the Domain Controller, under the C-Drive Directory, create three folders, "No-Access," "Read-Access," and "Write-Access"
- Using Client-1 as a host on the domain, login as a domain user and reach the network path of network shared resources "//dc-1"
- As a user of the domain, attempt to read "No-Access" and observe the denial of access prompt.
- As a user of the domain, attempt to read "Read-Access" and attempt to create or modify a file. Observe the denial of access prompt.
- As a user of the domain, attempt to read "write-Access" and attempt to create or modify a file.
- Using the domain controller, using the Server Manager, under "Computers and Users" on Active Directory create a Security Group "Accountants" on the domain.
- Add a user to the "accountants" Security Group and make them a member with Read/Write permissions through Active Directory.
- Restart the host computer on the domain and sign in as the added user of the "accountants" security groups.
- Using the Domain Controller, under the C-Drive Directory, create "Accountants" and share the folder into the domain with read and write permissions.
- As a user of the "Accountants" Security Group, attempt to read and modify the shared "accountants" folder.
